## Creating Files a Different Way

We have seen how to create text files using the `nano` editor.
Now, try the following command:

```bash
$ touch my_file.txt
```

1. What did the `touch` command do?
  When you look at your current directory using the GUI file explorer,
  does the file show up?

2. Use `ls -l` to inspect the files.  How large is `my_file.txt`?

3. When might you want to create a file this way?


## Moving Files to a new folder

After running the following commands,
Jamie realizes that she put the files `sucrose.dat` and `maltose.dat` into the wrong folder.
The files should have been placed in the `raw` folder.

```bash
$ ls -F
 analyzed/ raw/
$ ls -F analyzed
fructose.dat glucose.dat maltose.dat sucrose.dat
$ cd analyzed
```

Fill in the blanks to move these files to the `raw/` folder
(i.e. the one she forgot to put them in)

```bash
$ mv sucrose.dat maltose.dat ____/____
```


## Renaming Files

Suppose that you created a plain-text file in your current directory to contain a list of the
statistical tests you will need to do to analyze your data, and named it `statstics.txt`

After creating and saving this file you realize you misspelled the filename! You want to
correct the mistake, which of the following commands could you use to do so?

1. `cp statstics.txt statistics.txt`
2. `mv statstics.txt statistics.txt`
3. `mv statstics.txt .`
4. `cp statstics.txt .`


## Moving and Copying

What is the output of the closing `ls` command in the sequence shown below?

```bash
$ pwd
```

```output
/Users/jamie/data
```

```bash
$ ls
```

```output
proteins.dat
```

```bash
$ mkdir recombined
$ mv proteins.dat recombined/
$ cp recombined/proteins.dat ../proteins-saved.dat
$ ls
```

1. `proteins-saved.dat recombined`
2. `recombined`
3. `proteins.dat recombined`
4. `proteins-saved.dat`


## Using `rm` Safely

What happens when we execute `rm -i thesis_backup/quotations.txt`?
Why would we want this protection when using `rm`?


## Copy with Multiple Filenames

For this exercise, you can test the commands in the `shell-lesson-data/exercise-data` directory.

In the example below, what does `cp` do when given several filenames and a directory name?

```bash
$ mkdir backup
$ cp creatures/minotaur.dat creatures/unicorn.dat backup/
```

In the example below, what does `cp` do when given three or more file names?

```bash
$ cd creatures
$ ls -F
```

```output
basilisk.dat  minotaur.dat  unicorn.dat
```

```bash
$ cp minotaur.dat unicorn.dat basilisk.dat
```


## List filenames matching a pattern

When run in the `alkanes` directory, which `ls` command(s) will
produce this output?

`ethane.pdb   methane.pdb`

1. `ls *t*ane.pdb`
2. `ls *t?ne.*`
3. `ls *t??ne.pdb`
4. `ls ethane.*`


## More on Wildcards

Sam has a directory containing calibration data, datasets, and descriptions of
the datasets:

```bash
.
├── 2015-10-23-calibration.txt
├── 2015-10-23-dataset1.txt
├── 2015-10-23-dataset2.txt
├── 2015-10-23-dataset_overview.txt
├── 2015-10-26-calibration.txt
├── 2015-10-26-dataset1.txt
├── 2015-10-26-dataset2.txt
├── 2015-10-26-dataset_overview.txt
├── 2015-11-23-calibration.txt
├── 2015-11-23-dataset1.txt
├── 2015-11-23-dataset2.txt
├── 2015-11-23-dataset_overview.txt
├── backup
│   ├── calibration
│   └── datasets
└── send_to_bob
    ├── all_datasets_created_on_a_23rd
    └── all_november_files
```

Before heading off to another field trip, she wants to back up her data and
send some datasets to her colleague Bob. Sam uses the following commands
to get the job done:

```bash
$ cp *dataset* backup/datasets
$ cp ____calibration____ backup/calibration
$ cp 2015-____-____ send_to_bob/all_november_files/
$ cp ____ send_to_bob/all_datasets_created_on_a_23rd/
```

Help Sam by filling in the blanks.

The resulting directory structure should look like this

```bash
.

## Organizing Directories and Files

Jamie is working on a project, and she sees that her files aren't very well
organized:

```bash
$ ls -F
```

```output
analyzed/  fructose.dat    raw/   sucrose.dat
```

The `fructose.dat` and `sucrose.dat` files contain output from her data
analysis. What command(s) covered in this lesson does she need to run
so that the commands below will produce the output shown?

```bash
$ ls -F
```

```output
analyzed/   raw/
```

```bash
$ ls analyzed
```

```output
fructose.dat    sucrose.dat
```


## Reproduce a folder structure

You're starting a new experiment and would like to duplicate the directory
structure from your previous experiment so you can add new data.

Assume that the previous experiment is in a folder called `2016-05-18`,
which contains a `data` folder that in turn contains folders named `raw` and
`processed` that contain data files.  The goal is to copy the folder structure
of the `2016-05-18` folder into a folder called `2016-05-20`
so that your final directory structure looks like this:

```output
2016-05-20/
└── data
   ├── processed
   └── raw
```

Which of the following set of commands would achieve this objective?
What would the other commands do?

```bash
$ mkdir 2016-05-20
$ mkdir 2016-05-20/data
$ mkdir 2016-05-20/data/processed
$ mkdir 2016-05-20/data/raw
```

```bash
$ mkdir 2016-05-20
$ cd 2016-05-20
$ mkdir data
$ cd data
$ mkdir raw processed
```

```bash
$ mkdir 2016-05-20/data/raw
$ mkdir 2016-05-20/data/processed
```

```bash
$ mkdir -p 2016-05-20/data/raw
$ mkdir -p 2016-05-20/data/processed
```

```bash
$ mkdir 2016-05-20
$ cd 2016-05-20
$ mkdir data
$ mkdir raw processed
```
