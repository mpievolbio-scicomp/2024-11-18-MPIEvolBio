## Arranging Documents into Panels of Tabs

In the JupyterLab Main Work Area you can arrange documents into panels of tabs. Here is an
example from the [official documentation][jupyterlab].

<p align='center'>   <img alt="Multi-panel JupyterLab" src="fig/0_multipanel_jupyterlab_screenshot.png" width="750"/>
</p>

First, create a text file, Python console, and terminal window and arrange them into three
panels in the main work area. Next, create a notebook, terminal window, and text file and
arrange them into three panels in the main work area. Finally, create your own combination of
panels and tabs. What combination of panels and tabs do you think will be most useful for your
workflow?


## Command Vs. Edit

In the Jupyter notebook page are you currently in Command or Edit mode?  
Switch between the modes.
Use the shortcuts to generate a new cell.
Use the shortcuts to delete a cell.
Use the shortcuts to undo the last cell operation you performed.


## Creating Lists in Markdown

Create a nested list in a Markdown cell in a notebook that looks like this:

1. Get funding.
2. Do work.
  - Design experiment.
  - Collect data.
  - Analyze.
3. Write up.
4. Publish.

Note that the bullet list is indented 2 spaces so that it is inline with the items of the numbered list.

```
1.  Get funding.
2.  Do work.
    *   Design experiment.
    *   Collect data.
    *   Analyze.
3.  Write up.
4.  Publish.
```

## More Math

What is displayed when a Python cell in a notebook
that contains several calculations is executed?
For example, what happens when this cell is executed?

```python
7 * 3
2 + 1
```


## Change an Existing Cell from Code to Markdown

What happens if you write some Python in a code cell
and then you switch it to a Markdown cell?
For example,
put the following in a code cell:

```python
x = 6 * 7 + 12
print(x)
```

And then run it with <kbd>Shift</kbd>\+<kbd>Return</kbd> to be sure that it works as a code cell.
Now go back to the cell and use <kbd>Esc</kbd> then <kbd>m</kbd> to switch the cell to Markdown
and "run" it with <kbd>Shift</kbd>\+<kbd>Return</kbd>.
What happened and how might this be useful?


## Equations

Standard Markdown (such as we're using for these notes) won't render equations,
but the Notebook will.
Create a new Markdown cell
and enter the following:

```
$\sum_{i=1}^{N} 2^{-i} \approx 1$
```

(It's probably easier to copy and paste.)
What does it display?
What do you think the underscore, `_`, circumflex, `^`, and dollar sign, `$`, do?


## Closing JupyterLab

Practice closing and restarting the JupyterLab server.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints

- Python scripts are plain text files.
- Use the Jupyter Notebook for editing and running Python.
- The Notebook has Command and Edit modes.
- Use the keyboard and mouse to select and edit cells.
- The Notebook will turn Markdown into pretty-printed documentation.
- Markdown does most of what HTML does.
