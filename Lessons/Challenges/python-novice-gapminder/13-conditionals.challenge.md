## Tracing Execution

What does this program print?

```python
pressure = 71.9
if pressure > 50.0:
    pressure = 25.0
elif pressure <= 50.0:
    pressure = 0.0
print(pressure)
```


## Trimming Values

Fill in the blanks so that this program creates a new list
containing zeroes where the original list's values were negative
and ones where the original list's values were positive.

```python
original = [-1.5, 0.2, 0.4, 0.0, -1.3, 0.4]
result = ____
for value in original:
    if ____:
        result.append(0)
    else:
        ____
print(result)
```

```output
[0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1]
```


## Processing Small Files

Modify this program so that it only processes files with fewer than 50 records.

```python
import glob
import pandas as pd
for filename in glob.glob('data/*.csv'):
    contents = pd.read_csv(filename)
    ____:
        print(filename, len(contents))
```


## Initializing

Modify this program so that it finds the largest and smallest values in the list
no matter what the range of values originally is.

```python
values = [...some test data...]
smallest, largest = None, None
for v in values:
    if ____:
        smallest, largest = v, v
    ____:
        smallest = min(____, v)
        largest = max(____, v)
print(smallest, largest)
```

What are the advantages and disadvantages of using this method
to find the range of the data?
