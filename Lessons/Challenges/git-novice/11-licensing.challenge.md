## Can I Use Open License?

Find out whether you are allowed to apply an open license to your software.
Can you do this unilaterally,
or do you need permission from someone in your institution?
If so, who?

## What licenses have I already accepted?

Many of the software tools we use on a daily basis (including in this workshop) are
released as open-source software. Pick a project on GitHub from the list below, or
one of your own choosing. Find its license (usually in a file called `LICENSE` or
`COPYING`) and talk about how it restricts your use of the software. Is it one of
the licenses discussed in this session? How is it different?

- [Git](https://github.com/git/git), the source-code management tool
- [CPython](https://github.com/python/cpython), the standard implementation of the Python language
- [Jupyter](https://github.com/jupyter), the project behind the web-based Python notebooks we'll be using
- [EtherPad](https://github.com/ether/etherpad-lite), a real-time collaborative editor

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints

- The `LICENSE`, `LICENSE.md`, or `LICENSE.txt` file is often used in a repository to indicate how the contents of the repo may be used by others.
- People who incorporate General Public License (GPL'd) software into their own software must make the derived software also open under the GPL license if they decide to share it; most other open licenses do not require this.
- The Creative Commons family of licenses allow people to mix and match requirements and restrictions on attribution, creation of derivative works, further sharing, and commercialization.
- People who are not lawyers should not try to write licenses from scratch.
