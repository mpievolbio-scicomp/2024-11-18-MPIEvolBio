## How Reproducible Is My Work?

Ask one of your labmates to reproduce a result you recently obtained
using only what they can find in your papers or on the web.
Try to do the same for one of their results,
then try to do it for a result from a lab you work with.

## How to Track Large Data or Image Files using Git?

Large data or image files such as `.md5` or `.psd` file types can be tracked within
a github repository using the [Git Large File Storage](https://git-lfs.github.com)
open source extension tool.  This tool automatically uploads large file contents to
a remote server and replaces the file with a text pointer within the github repository.

Try downloading and installing the Git Large File Storage extension tool, then add
tracking of a large file to your github repository.  Ask a colleague to clone your
repository and describe what they see when they access that large file.
