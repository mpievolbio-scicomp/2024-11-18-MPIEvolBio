## Review Changes

The Owner pushed commits to the repository without giving any information
to the Collaborator. How can the Collaborator find out what has changed with
command line? And on GitHub?


## Comment Changes in GitHub

The Collaborator has some questions about one line change made by the Owner and
has some suggestions to propose.

With GitHub, it is possible to comment on the diff of a commit. Over the line of
code to comment, a blue comment icon appears to open a comment window.

The Collaborator posts her comments and suggestions using the GitHub interface.
