## Choosing a Commit Message

Which of the following commit messages would be most appropriate for the
last commit made to `guacamole.md`?

1. "Changes"
2. "Changed lemon for lime"
3. "Guacamole modified to the traditional recipe"


## Committing Changes to Git

Which command(s) below would save the changes of `myfile.txt`
to my local Git repository?

1. ```bash
   $ git commit -m "my recent changes"
   ```
2. ```bash
   $ git init myfile.txt
   $ git commit -m "my recent changes"
   ```
3. ```bash
   $ git add myfile.txt
   $ git commit -m "my recent changes"
   ```
4. ```bash
   $ git commit -m myfile.txt "my recent changes"
   ```


## Committing Multiple Files

The staging area can hold changes from any number of files
that you want to commit as a single snapshot.

1. Add some text to `guacamole.md` noting the rough price of the
  ingredients.
2. Create a new file `groceries.md` with a list of products and
  their prices for different markets.
3. Add changes from both files to the staging area,
   and commit those changes.


## `bio` Repository

- Create a new Git repository on your computer called `bio`.
- Write a three-line biography for yourself in a file called `me.txt`,
  commit your changes
- Modify one line, add a fourth line
- Display the differences
  between its updated state and its original state.
