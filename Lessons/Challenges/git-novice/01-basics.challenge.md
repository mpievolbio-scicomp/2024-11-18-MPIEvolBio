## Paper Writing

- Imagine you drafted an excellent paragraph for a paper you are writing, but later ruin
  it. How would you retrieve the *excellent* version of your conclusion? Is it even possible?

- Imagine you have 5 co-authors. How would you manage the changes and comments
  they make to your paper?  If you use LibreOffice Writer or Microsoft Word, what happens if
  you accept changes made using the `Track Changes` option? Do you have a
  history of those changes?
