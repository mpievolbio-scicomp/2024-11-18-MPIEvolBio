## GitHub GUI

Browse to your `recipes` repository on GitHub.
Under the Code tab, find and click on the text that says "XX commits" (where "XX" is some number).
Hover over, and click on, the three buttons to the right of each commit.
What information can you gather/explore from these buttons?
How would you get that same information in the shell?


## GitHub Timestamp

Create a remote repository on GitHub. Push the contents of your local
repository to the remote. Make changes to your local repository and push these
changes. Go to the repo you just created on GitHub and check the
[timestamps](../learners/reference.md#timestamp) of the files. How does GitHub
record times, and why?


## Push vs. Commit

In this episode, we introduced the "git push" command.
How is "git push" different from "git commit"?


## GitHub License and README files

In this episode we learned about creating a remote repository on GitHub, but when you initialized
your GitHub repo, you didn't add a README.md or a license file. If you had, what do you think
would have happened when you tried to link your local and remote repositories?
